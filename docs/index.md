# Near Node Flash

Near Node Flash, also known as Rabbit, provides a disaggregated chassis-local storage solution which utilizes SR-IOV over a PCIe Gen 4.0 switching fabric to provide a set of compute blades with NVMe storage. It also provides a dedicated storage processor to offload tasks such as storage preparation and data movement from the compute nodes.
